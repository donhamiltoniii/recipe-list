### Ingredients

- 2 lbs ground turkey
- 2 medium sweet potatoes
- 1 bag spinach (10 oz)
- 1 can black beans
- 250g cheddar cheese shredded

### Instructions

1. Wash potates and cut into ~1-inch pieces. Toss in a little olive oil and season (s&p, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, oregano)
1. Once well coated, put patatas in the air fryer at 400Â°F for 17ish minutes.
1. While the portainers cook, put a large pan on the stove at medium heat and then put the ground turkey in the same prep bowl that you used for the tubers and season (same spice mix).
1. Once you have a well seasoned meatball, make a big hamburger out of it and place it in the heated skillet.
1. Get a nice sear on both sides and then break the meat up into crumbly pieces that feel right to you.
1. Once your meat is cooked, add the spinach and then top with the drained black beans and the potaters.
1. Cook until the spinach is wilted and then mix everything together.
1. Finally, add the cheese and stir until everything is well combined.
1. Snag a couple bites for you because you're the chef and you did a good job. Add seasoning as necessary.
1. Serve
