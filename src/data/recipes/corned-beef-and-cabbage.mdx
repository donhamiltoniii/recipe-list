### Ingredients

#### Corned Beef and Cabbage

- 4 lb Corned beef brisket (ready-to-cook and brined, with seasoning packet)
- 2 cups Beef bone broth
- 1 large head Cabbage (cored and cut into 12 wedges)
- 2 large Onions (peeled and each cut into 6 large pieces)
- 1 lb Celery root (weight peeled, from ~1.5 lb with peel and stems; cut into 2 inch chunks)
- Sea salt
- Black pepper

#### Horseradish Sauce

- 3/4 cup Sour cream
- 1/2 cup Mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup Prepared horseradish
- 2 tsp Lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp Garlic powder

### Instructions

1. Place the brisket, fat side up, into the pressure cooker. Sprinkle the seasonings from the packet over the brisket and pat gently to help them stick.
1. Pour the beef bone broth into the pressure cooker, around the brisket but not over it, to avoid disturbing the seasonings.
1. Cover and turn the lid to seal. Press Manual Pressure (defaults to High) and increase time to 1 hour 15 minutes. Press Start. When time is up, use the Quick Release to release pressure. Once no steam is coming out, open the lid.
1. Meanwhile, stir together the horseradish sauce ingredients. Cover and chill in the fridge until the corned beef is ready.
1. After opening the lid of the pressure cooker, add the chopped onion, celery root, and cabbage into the broth around the beef, in that order (cabbage should be on top). Lightly season the cabbage with salt and pepper on top.
1. Cover and cook on High pressure again for 15 more minutes. Allow pressure to release naturally (preferred for more tender corned beef), which will take about 10 minutes, and after that use Quick Release.
1. Slice the corned beef into 1/2-inch slices, or if desired, first transfer it to a roasting pan and place under the broiler in the oven for a few minutes to brown (optional).
