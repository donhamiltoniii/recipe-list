### Ingredients

- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes
- Fine sea salt and ground black pepper

#### GENERAL TSO’S SAUCE:

- ½ cup chicken broth
- ⅓ cup Swerve confectioners’-style sweetener
- ¼ cup coconut vinegar or unseasoned rice vinegar
- ¼ cup thinly sliced green onions, plus more for garnish if desired
- 1 tablespoon plus 1¼ teaspoons wheat-free tamari, or ¼ cup coconut aminos
- 3 small dried red chiles, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1½ teaspoons grated fresh ginger
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- ¼ teaspoon guar gum

#### FOR SERVING (OPTIONAL):

- Fried Cauliflower Rice (here)
- Sautéed broccoli rabe

#### FOR GARNISH (OPTIONAL):

- Diced red chiles
- Red pepper flakes
- Sesame seeds

### Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 400°F.
1. Very lightly season the chicken on all sides with salt and pepper (the sauce will add seasoning). Place the chicken in a single layer in a pie pan that fits in the air fryer and cook for 5 minutes.
1. While the chicken cooks, make the sauce: In a small bowl, stir together all the sauce ingredients except the guar gum until well combined. Sift in the guar gum (if using) and whisk until well combined.
1. Pour the sauce over the chicken and, stirring every 5 minutes, cook for another 12 to 15 minutes, until the sauce is bubbly and thick and the chicken is cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165°F.
1. If you want the sauce to be even thicker and more flavorful, remove the chicken and return the sauce to the air fryer to cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.
1. Transfer the chicken to a large bowl. Serve with fried cauliflower rice and sautéed broccoli rabe, if desired, and garnish with diced red chiles, sliced green onions, red pepper flakes, and sesame seeds, if desired.
1. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat in a preheated 375°F air fryer for 5 minutes, or until heated through.
