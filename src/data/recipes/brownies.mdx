### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup / 8 TBS / 40 g - Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
- 1 cup / 4 oz / 113 g - Chopped Walnuts
- 2 cups butter
- 3/4 Cup / 144 g - Xylitol sweetener
- 4 - Eggs (whole)
- 1 tsp - Vanilla Extract

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
1. Melt the butter (or coconut butter).
1. On low speed, mix butter, cocoa powder, xylitol, vanilla, walnuts, and eggs until batter is smooth and fluffy; this can take a few minutes.  Grease a glass or metal 8” x 8” square pan with butter or coconut butter.
1. Pour mixture evenly in the baking pan.
1. Bake for 20-25 minutes – put toothpick in center to see if brownie mix sticks. If the toothpick comes out clean, the brownies are fully cooked.
1. Remove and let cool for 15 min.  These brownies must be kept in the refrigerator because they contain butter, which tends to melt at room temperature.
