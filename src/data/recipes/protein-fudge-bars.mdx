### Ingredients

- ½ cup smooth nut butter of choice
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 cup mashed sweet potato
- ¼ cup cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon espresso powder
- ¼ cup chocolate chips (optional)

#### PROTEIN FROSTING

- 2 scoops chocolate protein powder
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- Milk of your choice, as needed (dairy-free, if necessary)

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Cover an 8 × 4-inch loaf pan with aluminum foil, then lightly grease and set it aside.
1. In a small microwave-safe bowl or on the stovetop, melt your nut butter together with the maple syrup.
1. In a large mixing bowl, add the mashed sweet potato, melted nut butter mixture, cocoa powder, and espresso powder and mix well. If you’re using chocolate chips, stir them in.
1. Pour the mixture into the greased pan and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it’s just cooked through.
1. Remove the pan from the oven and allow the fudge to cool in the pan completely.
1. While the bars are cooling, make the protein frosting. In a small bowl, combine the protein powder with the maple syrup and your milk of choice until a thick frosting-like consistency remains.
1. Top the cooled fudge bars with the protein frosting or pour over melted chocolate and refrigerate until the bars are firm.
