### Ingredients

- 1-1/2 Cups / 6 oz / 170 g - Almond Flour
- 6 Eggs (beaten)
- 6 TBS / 3 oz / 85 g - melted Butter (grass-fed)
- 1 TSP - Baking Powder
- 1/2 TSP / 5 g - Sea Salt

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
1. In a bowl, stir together all ingredients until thoroughly mixed.
1. Grease the muﬃn rings for each muﬃn made.  Place the rings on a cooking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
1. Sprinkle a little almond ﬂour on the mat inside of each ring.  Fill each ring with muﬃn batter.
1. Bake the muﬃns for 20 minutes or until they are lightly browned on the top, watching carefully so they do not burn.
1. Allow the muﬃns to cool for several minutes on the sheet.  Once they are ﬁrm, use a thin spatula to move the muﬃns onto a cooling cloth or rack and remove the rings.
1. When ready to serve, fork-split the muﬃns, butter and lightly brown the inside in a sauté pan or toast in a toaster oven and then butter, if desired.
1. These No-Grain English Muﬃns are excellent for making sandwiches.
1. Enjoy!
