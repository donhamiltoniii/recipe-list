## Primary Entrée

### Component Profile:

- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 8 ounces (approximately 227 grams) lean ground turkey
- 1 cup pre-cooked lentils (or 1/2 cup dry lentils, hydrated and prepared)
- 1 small Allium cepa (onion), finely diced
- 2 cloves Allium sativum (garlic), minced
- 1 cup finely chopped Brassica oleracea (spinach or kale)
- 1 teaspoon ground Cuminum cyminum (cumin)
- 1/2 teaspoon Capsicum annuum (smoked paprika)
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder (optional, for enhanced piquancy)
- Sodium chloride and Piper nigrum (salt and black pepper), to taste
- Citrus limon wedge (optional, for finishing acidity)

### Procedural Methodology:

1. In a medium-sized sauté pan, heat olive oil over medium thermal input until shimmering.
2. Add diced onion and minced garlic; allow to soften and become aromatic, approximately 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Incorporate ground turkey and continue cooking until the protein is thoroughly browned and cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes.
4. Introduce pre-cooked lentils, leafy greens, and selected spices into the skillet. Continue sautéing for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, ensuring even distribution and thermal integration of all components.
5. Optionally, finish with freshly squeezed lemon juice to enhance brightness and balance.
