### Ingredients

#### Sauce

- 2 tablespoons Clarified Butter or ghee
- 1 medium yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
- 2 tablespoons mild curry powder
- 1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
- 1 can (13.5 ounces) full-fat coconut milk
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- Black pepper

#### Cauliflower Rice

- 1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 2 tablespoons Clarified Butter or ghee
- ⅓ cup Chicken Bone Broth or Whole30-compatible chicken broth
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1¼ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into bite-size pieces
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for serving

### Instructions

#### The Sauce:

1. Melt the butter in a large skillet or sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeño, and ginger and cook, stirring, until the vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes. Add the curry powder and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and coconut milk and bring to a boil. Add the salt and black pepper to taste. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until slightly thickened and reduced, 15 to 20 minutes.

#### The Cauliflower Rice:

1. Place half the cauliflower florets in a food processor and pulse until they have broken down to a rice-like consistency, 15 to 20 pulses. (Don’t overcrowd the cauliflower in the food processor, and don’t overpulse or the “rice” will get mushy.) Transfer to a bowl and rice the remaining cauliflower.
1. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. When the butter is hot, add the riced cauliflower to the skillet. Stir to coat. Add the broth, salt, and pepper. Cover the pan and steam the cauliflower until tender, but not mushy or wet, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Cover to keep warm until ready to serve.
1. Stir the chicken into the sauce. Reduce the heat to medium. Simmer, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat if necessary, until the chicken is cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the cilantro. Serve the chicken and sauce over the cauliflower rice, topped with additional cilantro, if desired.
