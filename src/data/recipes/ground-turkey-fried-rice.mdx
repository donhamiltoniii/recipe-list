### Ingredients

- 1.75 lb ground turkey
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 small capsicum (bell peppers), diced
- 6 eggs, beaten
- 1 lb broccoli, chopped
- 0.5 lb snap peas, trimmed
- 4 cups cooked rice
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/8 cup sesame oil
- 1/8 cup honey
- 1/8 cup chili sauce

### Instructions

1. **Mix the Sauce:**  
   In a small bowl, stir together soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, and chili sauce. Set aside.

2. **Cook the Turkey:**  
   In a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground turkey until browned. Remove from the pan and set aside.

3. **Sauté the Vegetables:**  
   In the same pan, sauté onion and bell peppers for 3–4 minutes until softened. Add broccoli and snap peas, cooking for another 4–5 minutes.

4. **Scramble the Eggs:**  
   Push the veggies to one side. Pour in the beaten eggs and scramble until cooked through. Mix with the vegetables.

5. **Combine and Stir-Fry:**  
   Add the turkey and cooked rice to the pan. Stir well to break up clumps.

6. **Add Sauce and Finish:**  
   Pour in the sauce and stir-fry everything for 3–5 minutes, allowing it to coat and slightly caramelize.

7. **Serve Hot:**  
   Dish up and enjoy immediately, or store for meal prep.
