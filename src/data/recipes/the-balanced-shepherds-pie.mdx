### Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons ghee or grass-fed butter, divided
- 4½ cups chopped cauliflower florets
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¾ teaspoon salt, divided
- 1 cup packed minced fresh spinach
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 pound ground turkey
- 1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 tablespoons coconut aminos
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Grease all sides of a 9-inch square casserole dish using 1 tablespoon of ghee.
1. In a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of ghee over medium-high heat. Add the cauliflower, garlic powder, and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes.
1. In another skillet, melt the remaining tablespoon of ghee over medium-high heat. Add the spinach, carrots, onion, garlic, and remaining ½ teaspoon of salt and cook for 5 minutes, stirring continually. Add the turkey and continue to cook for about 10 minutes, breaking the turkey up as it cooks and stirring occasionally, until the meat is cooked through. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, coconut aminos, thyme, and pepper and stir to combine. Remove from the heat.
1. Transfer the cauliflower from the skillet to a food processor and blend until smooth.
1. Spoon the turkey mixture into the casserole dish and spread out evenly. Spoon the cauliflower mash over the turkey and spread evenly. Bake for 15 minutes, until the cauliflower starts to brown on top.
