### Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil or avocado oil
- ¾ cup carrots, finely chopped into cubes
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 1 large green bell pepper, de-seeded and chopped
- 1 pound lean ground beef, (can swap for ground turkey or ground chicken)
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- ¾ cup crushed tomatoes
- ½ tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp yellow mustard or Dijon mustard
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- Salt & pepper, to taste
- 4 buns of choice

### Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
1. Add the chopped carrots and sauté for 3-4 minutes until they begin to soften.
1. Add the chopped onion, green bell pepper, and a pinch of salt. Sauté until the vegetables are cooked through and soft and the onions are starting to brown, about 5-8 more minutes.
1. Push the vegetables to the side of the skillet and add the ground beef. Brown the beef until it’s about 75% cooked, stirring often and seasoning with some salt.
1. Once the beef is mostly browned, mix it with the vegetables in the skillet.
1. Add the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, honey, mustard, and garlic powder to the skillet. Stir everything together until well combined.
1. Continue to cook, stirring often, until the meat is fully cooked and everything is heated through and bubbly. About 3 – 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. If you prefer a saucier consistency, you can add about 1/4 cup of water to the skillet. Let it bubble and thicken slightly.
1. Serve the mixture over rice, quinoa, gluten-free buns, cornbread, or on buns. Enjoy your healthy sloppy joes!
