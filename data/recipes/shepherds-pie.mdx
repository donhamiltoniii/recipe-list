### Ingredients

#### For the filling

- 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic minced
- 1 large onion chopped
- 1 large carrot finely chopped
- 1 rib celery finely chopped
- 1 cup mushrooms finely chopped
- 1 1/2 lbs ground beef
- 1/4 cup almond flour
- 2 tablespoons tomato sauce
- 1 beef boullion
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 cup beef stock

#### For the mashed cauliflower

- 2 1/2 lbs cauliflower chopped
- 2/3 cups milk
- 2 tablespoon butter melted
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper

#### For the golden crust

- 3 tablespoons parmesan cheese finely grated
- 2 tablespoons butter melted

### Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large pan and place over medium heat. Once hot, add the onions and garlic and cook for a minute. Add the carrots and celery for 5-6 minutes, until tender. Add the mushrooms and cook for a further minute.
1. Turn the heat up to high and add the beef and cook until no longer pink. Add the flour and mix in. Add the tomato paste, bouillon cube, Worcestershire sauce, and bay leaves, then the beef stock. Bring it to simmer, before reducing it to medium heat. Cook for 30-40 minutes, until thick and gravy-like.
1. Transfer the filling into a 9 x 13-inch baking dish and let it cool to room temperature.
1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F.
1. Steam your cauliflower in a pot until soft and tender. Drain then place back in the pot. Using a hand mixer, blend the cauliflower until smooth. Add in the butter and milk. Add the salt and pepper.
1. Spread the cauliflower mixture on top of the pie and use a fork to decorate the top. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese then drizzle with the butter.
1. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until deep golden brown and bubbling on the sides. Remove from the oven and sit for 5 minutes, before sprinkling with fresh thyme and serving.
