### Ingredients

- 6 (4-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

#### FOR SAUCE

- 2 tablespoons unsalted grass-fed butter
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- ½ cup 2% organic milk
- ¾ cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt
- ½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon sea salt

### Instructions

1. To make Chicken: Preheat oven to 350°F.
1. Arrange chicken in a single layer in a 9" x 13" baking dish and sprinkle garlic powder, salt, and pepper on top. Bake 25 minutes or until chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F. Remove from oven and allow to cool 30 minutes.
1. To make Sauce: While chicken is cooking, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook 2 minutes. Add milk and yogurt and stir until combined. Reduce heat to low and add cheese in small batches, stirring in between, until it melts. Stir in salt and pepper. Remove from heat and allow to cool 30 minutes.
1. Transfer Chicken to each of six airtight containers. Scoop equal amounts Sauce on top. Cover and store in refrigerator up to 1 week, until ready to eat.
1. To serve, transfer to a skillet and cook over medium-low heat 5 minutes or until heated through.
