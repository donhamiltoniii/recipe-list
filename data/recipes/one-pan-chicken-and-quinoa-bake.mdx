### Ingredients

- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into cubes
- 1 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed
- 1 cup chopped zucchini
- 1 cup chopped bell peppers (any color)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
1. In a bowl, toss together the chicken, quinoa, zucchini, bell peppers, olive oil, broth, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
1. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Cover tightly with foil.
1. Bake for 30-35 minutes, then uncover and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and quinoa is tender.

### Tips

- Add other chopped veggies: broccoli, carrots, mushrooms work well.
- Swap quinoa for brown rice or another whole grain if you prefer.
- For extra cheesy goodness, sprinkle with some Parmesan cheese during the last few minutes of baking.
