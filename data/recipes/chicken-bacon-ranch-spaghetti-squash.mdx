### Ingredients

- 1 large spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise
- 1 pound cooked boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- ⅔ Ranch Dressing
- ¼ cup light coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 6 slices no-sugar-added bacon, cooked and crumbled
- 2 cups chopped fresh spinach
- 1 teaspoon Flavor God Ranch Topper

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

1. Using a fork, shred squash and transfer to a 9" x 9" baking dish.
1. Add cooked chicken, ranch dressing, coconut milk, nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper to a medium bowl and whisk until smooth. Pour mixture over squash and stir to coat. Stir in bacon and spinach. Sprinkle ranch seasoning on top.
1. Bake 20 minutes or until sauce is hot and bubbly. Remove from oven and allow to cool 1 hour.
1. Divide evenly into six airtight containers. Cover and store in refrigerator up to 1 week, or in freezer up to 3 months, until ready to eat.
