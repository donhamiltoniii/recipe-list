### Ingredients

- 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1/2 lb Brussels sprouts, halved
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
- 1 small red onion, cut into wedges
- Fresh thyme or rosemary (optional)

### Instructions

1. In a bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, honey, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.
1. Place chicken thighs in the mixture, making sure they are coated evenly. Marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to a few hours in the refrigerator for more flavor.
1. Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C).
1. On a large baking sheet, toss Brussels sprouts, carrots, and red onion with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread them out in an even layer.
1. In a large skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Sear the marinated chicken thighs for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown.
1. Place the seared chicken thighs on top of the vegetables on the baking sheet. Drizzle any remaining marinade over the chicken.
1. Roast in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the vegetables are caramelized and the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C).
1. Garnish with fresh thyme or rosemary if desired, and serve directly from the pan for a rustic presentation.
