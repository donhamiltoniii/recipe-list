### Ingredients

- 2 cups shredded coconut (160 g)
- 1 cup coconut milk, refrigerated (240 g)
- 1 tbsp rice or agave syrup
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- ⅔ cup dark chocolate, melted (100 g)
- Shredded coconut (about ½ cup)

### Instructions

1. Add the four ingredients for the balls to a food processor and pulse two or three times to incorporate everything. You should be left with a rather firm texture.
1. Transfer the mixture into a bowl, cover with some foil and refrigerate for an hour to let it thicken.
1. Remove from the refrigerator and use an ice-cream scoop or a spoon to scoop the mixture and form little balls using your hands.
1. Add shredded coconut into a bowl and melted chocolate into another.
1. Roll half of the balls in shredded coconut to create the Raffaello bliss balls.
1. For the bounty bliss balls, dip the other half of the refrigerated balls into the melted dark chocolate to create a coating. Decorate with some sprinkled coconut shreds if you like.
1. Line all of the bliss balls on a plate with some parchment paper and refrigerate for another hour to let them set.
1. Serve chilled or keep them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.
