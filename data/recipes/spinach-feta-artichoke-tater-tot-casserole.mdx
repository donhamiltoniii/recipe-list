### Ingredients

- 12 large eggs
- 2/3 cup half-and-half
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon dried dill
- 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
- 2 cups frozen quartered artichoke hearts, thawed and squeezed dry
- 1 1/2 cups frozen chopped spinach, thawed, drained and squeezed dry
- 1/2 cup frozen diced onions
- 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
- 13 ounces frozen potato tots (about 3 cups), thawed
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Optional: add protein of your choosing to bump up protein content. Ground beef, or shredded chicken are good.

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Coat a 7-by-11-inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, garlic powder, oregano, dill and pepper together in the prepared dish until thoroughly combined. Scatter artichoke hearts, spinach and onions over the egg mixture; sprinkle evenly with feta. Arrange potato tots over the feta in a single layer, leaving about ¼ inch between each tot.
1. Cover with foil and bake until the middle is just set and the edges are slightly golden brown, 50 to 55 minutes. Sprinkle with salt before serving.
