### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons avocado oil
- ½ white onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon coconut aminos
- 1 cup canned diced tomatoes
- 3 cups Easy Slow-Cooker Bone Broth
- ½ cup salted natural peanut butter or sunbutter, no sugar added
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- ¼ teaspoon turmeric
- 1 small head cauliflower, diced
- 2 cups cilantro, divided
- 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt or more to taste
- 1 avocado, sliced
- ¼ cup sesame oil
- ¼ cup full-fat Greek yogurt (optional)

### Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium. Sauté the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and ginger.
1. Add the coconut aminos, tomatoes, broth, peanut butter, and spices and bring to a gentle simmer. Stir in the cauliflower and half of the cilantro; then cook at a gentle simmer for about 10 minutes.
1. Remove from the heat and carefully transfer the soup to a blender, working in batches if necessary. Vent the blender by removing the plug from the lid and covering the opening with a kitchen towel. Blend on medium until the soup is smooth.
1. Return the soup to the pot, add the shrimp, and cook over medium until opaque, about 3 minutes. Taste and add salt to taste. Divide the soup among four bowls and serve with sliced avocado, sesame oil, and yogurt if desired, with the remaining cilantro on top.
