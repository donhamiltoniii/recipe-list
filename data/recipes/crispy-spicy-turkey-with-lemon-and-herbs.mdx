### Ingredients

- 1 pound ground turkey
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- Black pepper
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- ¾ teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus more as needed
- 3 tablespoons coconut oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 medium head cauliflower, broken into florets
- 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped almonds, toasted
- 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
- ⅓ cup snipped fresh mint
- Lemon wedges

### Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mix together the turkey, ½ teaspoon of the salt, and black pepper to taste. Shape the turkey mixture into two ¼-inch-thick patties. In a small bowl, combine the paprika, cumin seeds, and red pepper flakes; stir well to blend.
1. Heat 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Very carefully place the patties in the skillet (they will be soft); cook the patties, undisturbed, until the bottoms are browned and crisp, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium. Break the patties into small pieces; sprinkle the spice mixture and the garlic over the meat. Cook, stirring, until the spices are fragrant and the meat is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more.
1. Meanwhile, in a food processor, pulse the cauliflower (in batches, if necessary) until the pieces are the size of rice. In a large skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons coconut oil over medium heat. Add the cauliflower and the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the almonds and lemon zest.
1. Serve the turkey over the cauliflower rice. Sprinkle with the mint and additional red pepper flakes, if desired. Pass lemon wedges alongside.
