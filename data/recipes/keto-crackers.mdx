### Ingredients

- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2 ounces (1/4 cup) cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon granulated garlic
- 1⁄2 teaspoon dried rosemary
- S & P to taste

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. Combine Parmesan cheese, Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and almond flour in a medium saucepan and heat over low heat. Stir constantly until cheeses have just melted. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
1. Once cheese mixture has adequately cooled, add egg and spices and stir to combine. Mixture should be doughlike.
1. Place dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll out into a rectangle. Cut the dough into crackers, approximately 11/2" squares, and arrange in a single layer on the baking sheet.
1. Bake 12 minutes, turning crackers over once during cooking. If after 12 minutes crackers are not crispy, continue baking until they reach your desired level of doneness.
1. Allow to cool slightly before eating.
