### Ingredients

- 12 slices bacon
- 10 large eggs
- 0.25 cup sour cream
- 0.5 cup shredded cheddar
- 0.5 cup shredded mozzarella
- 2 jalapeños, minced
- 1 tsp garlic powder

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until slightly browned but still pliable. Set aside on a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
1. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, sour cream, cheeses, minced jalapeño and garlic powder. Season with salt and pepper.
1. Using nonstick cooking spray, grease a muffin tin. Line each well with one slice of bacon, then pour egg mixture into each muffin cup until about two-thirds of the way to the top. Top each muffin with a jalapeño slice.
1. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the eggs no longer look wet. Cool slightly before removing from the muffin tin.
