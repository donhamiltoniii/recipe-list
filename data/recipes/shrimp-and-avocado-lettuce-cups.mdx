### Ingredients

1 tablespoon ghee

- ½ pound shrimp
- ½ cup halved grape tomatoes
- 2 avocados
- Pink Himalayan salt
- 1⁄2 head of cabbage (usually purple but either will do)
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 4 butter lettuce leaves, rinsed and patted dry
- 1 tablespoon Spicy Red Pepper Miso Mayo
- 1 cup feta

### Instructions

1. In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, heat the ghee. Add the shrimp and cook. (I use cooked shrimp, so they take only about 1 minute to heat through, and I flip them halfway through cooking. Uncooked shrimp take about 2 minutes to cook.) Season with pink Himalayan salt and pepper. Shrimp are cooked when they turn pink and opaque.
1. Shred cabbage, halve tomatoes, and cube avocado.
1. Mix shrimp and veggies with remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly.
1. Serve
