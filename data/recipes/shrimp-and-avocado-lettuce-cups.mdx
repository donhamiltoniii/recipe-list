### Ingredients

1 tablespoon ghee

- ½ pound shrimp
- ½ cup halved grape tomatoes
- ½ avocado, sliced
- Pink Himalayan salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 4 butter lettuce leaves, rinsed and patted dry
- 1 tablespoon Spicy Red Pepper Miso Mayo

### Instructions

1. In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, heat the ghee. Add the shrimp and cook. (I use cooked shrimp, so they take only about 1 minute to heat through, and I flip them halfway through cooking. Uncooked shrimp take about 2 minutes to cook.) Season with pink Himalayan salt and pepper. Shrimp are cooked when they turn pink and opaque.
1. Season the tomatoes and avocado with pink Himalayan salt and pepper.
1. Divide the lettuce cups between two plates. Fill each cup with shrimp, tomatoes, and avocado. Drizzle the mayo sauce on top and serve.
