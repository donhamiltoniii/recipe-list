### Ingredients

- 3-4 pounds (1.4-1.8 kg) pork shoulder (also known as pork butt or Boston butt)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika (smoked paprika adds a nice flavor)
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 2-3 sprigs fresh thyme)
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary (or 2-3 sprigs fresh rosemary)
- 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).
1. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder to create a dry rub.
1. Place the pork shoulder on a clean surface and pat it dry with paper towels. This helps the dry rub stick better.
1. Rub the dry spice mixture evenly over the entire surface of the pork shoulder.
1. Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
1. Once the oil is hot, add the pork shoulder and sear it on all sides until it's nicely browned, about 3-4 minutes per side.
1. Remove the pork shoulder from the skillet and set it aside.
1. In the same skillet, add the chicken or vegetable broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. This adds flavor to the sauce.
1. Return the pork shoulder to the skillet, and add the thyme and rosemary on top.
1. Cover the skillet or Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil.
1. Place the skillet or Dutch oven in the preheated oven and roast for about 3 to 3.5 hours or until the pork shoulder is tender and easily shreds with a fork.
1. Check the pork shoulder periodically and baste it with the juices in the pan to keep it moist.
1. Once the pork is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 15 minutes before shredding it with two forks.
1. Serve the shredded pork with the pan juices as a delicious and flavorful sauce.
