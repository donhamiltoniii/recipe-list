### Ingredients

- 2 tbsp Yellow onion (freshly grated)
- 12 oz Canned salmon (drained; unsalted)
- 1 large Egg
- 1⁄3 cup Mayonnaise 1
- 1 cup Pork rinds (crushed; measured after crushing)
- 3⁄4 tsp Italian seasoning
- 11⁄2 tsp Sea salt
- 1⁄2 tsp Smoked paprika
- 1⁄4 tsp Black pepper
- 3 tbsp Olive oil

### Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients except olive oil. Mix until just combined, but don't over mix.
1. Using your hands, form mixture into 6 (1/2-inch thick) patties and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. Patties will feel wet and sticky. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to firm up.
1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add salmon patties to the skillet without touching each other, and cook for 3-4 minutes, until golden brown on the bottom. Flip patties and cook for another 3-4 minutes, until browned on the other side.
