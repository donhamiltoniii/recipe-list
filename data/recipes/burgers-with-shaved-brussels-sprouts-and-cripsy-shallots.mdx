### Ingredients

- 1½ pounds ground bison (also called ground buffalo)
- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1½ tablespoons balsamic vinegar, plus more for serving
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes Salt and black pepper
- 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and coarsely shaved (see Tip)
- 2 tablespoons Clarified Butter or ghee, melted
- 2 large shallots, thinly sliced

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
1. In a large bowl, combine the bison, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, vinegar, the rosemary, thyme, red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper to taste. Form the meat mixture into four ¾-inch-thick patties. Spread the Brussels sprouts in an even layer on a large rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with the butter and season with salt and black pepper. Toss until well coated. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring once or twice, until the sprouts are lightly browned and crisp on the edges. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy skillet (cast iron works well) over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and season lightly with salt and black pepper. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots are crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove the shallots from the skillet and drain on paper towels.
1. Add the bison patties to the hot skillet and cook, turning once, until they register 160°F in the center, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove the burgers from the skillet and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
1. Serve the burgers topped with the Brussels sprouts and crispy shallots and drizzled with balsamic vinegar.
