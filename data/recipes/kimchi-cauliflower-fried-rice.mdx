### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons ghee, avocado oil or other cooking fat
- 1 cup kimchi (more or less to taste), cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, finely minced
- 1 - 2 cups cooked protein, chicken, pork, beef cut into bite-sized pieces or shredded, other options: shrimp or 3 eggs, scrambled
- 5 cups Cascadian Farms Frozen Riced Cauliflower Blend with Stir-Fry Vegetables\* (1.5 packages)
- 2 tablespoons kimchi juice
- 1 tablespoon coconut aminos (you can also use soy sauce or tamari)
- sea salt, to taste

### Instructions

1. To a wok or a large skillet over medium-high heat, add ghee or other cooking oil, add the chopped kimchi, garlic and ginger. Cook for several minutes until the kimchi starts to brown a little, 3 to 5 minutes. Add any cooked protein (not scrambled eggs or shrimp). Heat through. Give it a couple minutes.
1. Add the Cascadian Farms Frozen Riced Cauliflower Blend with Stir-Fry Vegetables, along with the Kimchi juice and coconut aminos. Reduce heat to medium. Cover the wok or skillet and cook for 3 minutes. You want the veggies to be no longer frozen and barely tender but definitely not mushy.
1. Take the lid off, increase the heat to medium-high, cook another minute, add scrambled eggs if using or cooked shrimp. Turn off the heat. Taste and add sea salt to taste, if necessary (likely it will not be).
1. Serve the Kimchi Cauliflower Fried Rice topped with a fried egg, sesame oil, toasted seaweed or nori sheets, srirarcha or sesame oil, scallions, microgreens, etc
