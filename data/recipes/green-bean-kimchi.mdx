### Ingredients

- 1 pound green beans, cut into 1⁄2- to 1-inch pieces
- 1 bunch scallions, cut into 1⁄2-inch pieces
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
- 2 teaspoons good-quality fermented fish sauce
- 1 pound fresh gochu peppers, or other thick-walled hot red peppers
- 1.5 teaspoons salt

### Instructions

1. Combine the green beans and scallions in a large bowl. Add the garlic, ginger, and fish sauce. Mix and set aside while you prepare the peppers.
1. For a hotter ferment, leave the seeds in the peppers. Process them with the salt to a mash-like consistency in a food processor. Add the pepper mash to the green bean mixture and massage everything together with your hands. Remember to wear gloves.
1. Pack the kimchi into a jar, pressing out any air pockets as you go. Press a ziplock bag against the surface of the ferment, fill the bag with water, and zip it closed.
1. Place the jar in a corner of the kitchen to ferment. If you see air pockets, remove the bag, press the ferment back down with a clean utensil, rinse the bag, and replace.
1. Ferment for 10 to 12 days. You will know the kimchi is ready when the flavors have mingled and the pungency is pleasantly fused with acidic tones. During fermentation, the red of the pepper will become more orange and the green beans will turn a dull yellowish green.
1. Screw on the lid and store in the refrigerator, where the kimchi will keep for 8 to 12 months.
