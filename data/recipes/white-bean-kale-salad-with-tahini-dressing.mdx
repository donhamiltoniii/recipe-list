### Ingredients

#### BEANS

- 1 15-ounce can white or butter beans (rinsed and drained)
- 1/2 lemon, juiced (1/2 lemon yields ~1 Tbsp or 15 ml)
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 1/4 tsp sea salt
- 1 Tbsp fresh parsley (chopped // plus more for topping)

#### SALAD

- 10 ounces kale (chopped // large stems removed)
- 1 lemon, juiced (1 lemon yields ~2 Tbsp or 30 ml)
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 Tbsp maple syrup
- 1 pinch each sea salt + black pepper
- 1 clove garlic (minced)

#### DRESSING

- 1/3 cup tahini
- 1 clove garlic (minced)
- 1 1/2 lemons, juiced (1 1/2 lemons yield ~3-4 Tbsp or 45-60 ml)
- 1-2 Tbsp maple syrup
- 1 pinch each sea salt + black pepper
- Hot water (to thin)

### Instructions

1. If making croutons (optional), preheat oven to 325 degrees F (162 C).
1. Add bread cubes to a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together oil, garlic powder, sea salt and pepper, and pour over bread. Toss to combine. Season once more with a bit more garlic powder, salt and pepper. Toss once more.
1. Spread on a bare baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Flip/stir at the 10-minute mark to ensure even baking. Set aside.
1. In the meantime, add drained beans to a small mixing bowl and add lemon juice, olive oil, sea salt, and fresh parsley. Toss to combine. Set aside.
1. Add kale to a large mixing bowl with lemon juice, olive oil, maple syrup, salt, pepper and minced garlic. Use your hands to massage the kale and break down its texture a bit, and to season the salad.
1. To prepare dressing, add tahini, garlic, lemon juice, maple syrup, sea salt, and pepper to a small mixing bowl. Whisk to combine, then add hot water to thin until pourable. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Set aside.
1. Lastly, add beans, croutons, and 3/4 of the dressing to the kale and toss to combine. Serve with any additional dressing and garnish with vegan parmesan cheese (optional). Best when fresh. If serving later, store dressing and croutons separate.
