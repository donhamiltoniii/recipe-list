### Ingredients

- 8 medium jalapeño peppers, stemmed, halved, and seeded
- 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 2 pounds ground turkey
- S & P to taste
- 8 slices thin-cut bacon

### Instructions

1. Spray the air fryer basket with avocado oil. Preheat the air fryer to 400°F.
1. Stuff each jalapeño half with a few tablespoons of cream cheese. Place the halves back together again to form 8 jalapeños.
1. Season the ground turkey. Flatten about ¼ pound of ground beef in the palm of your hand and place a stuffed jalapeño in the center.
1. Fold the beef around the jalapeño, forming an egg shape.
1. Wrap the beef-covered jalapeño with a slice of bacon and secure it with a toothpick.
1. Place the jalapeños in the air fryer basket, leaving space between them and cook for 15 minutes.
