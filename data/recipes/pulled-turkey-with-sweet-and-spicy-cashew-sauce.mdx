### Ingredients

#### FOR THE TURKEY

- 2 cups Chicken Bone Broth
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 turkey breast tenderloin (about 1 pound)
- ¼ cup coconut milk
- 3 tablespoons Whole30-compatible cashew butter
- 2 tablespoons coconut aminos or Red Boat fish sauce
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ Thai chile or jalapeño, seeded and finely chopped

#### FOR THE NOODLES

- 2 medium zucchini
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
- Raw or toasted cashews, chopped

### Instructions

#### MAKE THE TURKEY:

1. Combine the broth and bay leaf in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and add the turkey. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board, reserving ¼ cup of the cooking liquid in the saucepan. Let the turkey cool slightly. Use two forks to shred the turkey.
1. Whisk the coconut milk, cashew butter, coconut aminos, garlic, and chile into the broth in the saucepan. Cook, stirring, over medium-low heat until heated through and slightly thickened. Stir the shredded turkey into the sauce. Keep warm while you make the noodles.

#### MAKE THE NOODLES:

1. Use a vegetable peeler or sharp knife to cut the zucchini lengthwise into long, thin strips. Heat the coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the zucchini noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with the salt and black pepper.
1. Serve the turkey and sauce over the zucchini noodles. Garnish with the cilantro and cashews, if desired.
