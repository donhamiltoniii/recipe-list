description: Change up your carb source with this easy-to-make plantain and turkey recipe. If you haven’t tried plantains, the green ones taste a bit like potatoes when cooked, while the ripe yellow ones taste like bananas. While you can eat ripe plantains, they’re usually boiled, baked, or fried. Choose green plantains, as they’re a bit lower in calories than the yellow variety. The turkey adds spice and protein to help with satiety and muscle maintenance.

### Ingredients

- 2 lb (907g) ground turkey breast
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup ketchup
- 2 tbsp chili powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/4 tsp cayenne
- 2 large green plantains
- 1/2 cup low-fat cheese

### Instructions

1. Cut the ends off the plantains and peel them. Slice into 2-inch (5cm) sections. Place the plantains in a medium-sized pot. Add the salt and fill with just enough liquid to cover the plantains. Bring to a soft boil for 15 to 20 minutes or until the plantains are golden and tender.
2. While the plantains are softening, preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the turkey in a large pan over medium heat. Brown the turkey, using a spatula to break it into small pieces. Once the turkey is browned, reduce the heat to low and add the water, ketchup, and spices. Stir and allow the turkey to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. While the turkey is simmering, spray a 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray. Remove the plantains from the water and place in a large glass or metal bowl. Take the turkey off the heat and allow it to cool for a few minutes. Mash the plantains with a fork, adding some of the water from the pot if the plantains appear dry. Once the plantains are thoroughly mashed, add the turkey to the bowl. Use a fork or spatula to incorporate the ingredients.
4. Scoop the mixture into each muffin cup, pressing the mixture down with a spatula or spoon. Top each cup with a sprinkling of cheese. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.
5. Transfer to meal prep containers and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
