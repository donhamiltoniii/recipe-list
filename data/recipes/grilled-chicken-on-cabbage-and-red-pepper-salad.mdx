### Ingredients

- 4 cups finely shredded green cabbage
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- ½ cup thinly sliced red bell pepper
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (20 ounces total), split and pounded to ¼-inch thickness
- 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon quatres épices seasoning
- Freshly milled black pepper Kosher salt to taste

#### Dressing

- One 1.7-ounce can flat anchovy fillets, drained
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 3 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

### Instructions

1. Sprinkle the cabbage with vinegar, then toss in a large bowl. Arrange the pepper on top of the cabbage, cover, and refrigerate until serving time. To make the dressing, crush and blend the ingredients with a mortar and pestle (or use a food processor with the steel blade). Set it aside.
1. Dab the chicken breasts with the olive oil, then rub in the quatres épices, salt and pepper. Heat a ridged grill pan or a sauté pan over high heat. Cook the meat on one side without disturbing, until brown on the edges, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook the second side until the chicken is cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes total.
1. Mound one-quarter of the cabbage mixture on a dinner plate and top with a grilled chicken breast. Just before serving, toss the cabbage and pepper with the dressing.
