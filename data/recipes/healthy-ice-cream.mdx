### Ingredients

- 2 Cups / 17 oz / 480 g - organic Heavy Cream
- 1 Cup / 8 oz / 227 g - organic Coconut Milk
- 2/3 Cup / 133 g - Sweetener (recommend Xylitol or Erythitol)
- 6 large organic Egg Yolks
- 1/2 Cup / 8 TBS / 40 g - unsweetened Cocoa Powder
- 1/4 TSP - Xanthan Gum (this helps to prevent Ice Cream turning into ice in the freezer)
- 1/8 TSP / 1 g - Vanilla
- OPTIONAL: Chopped Pecans (1 Cup) and Peanut Butter (1/2 Cup) swirled in

### Instructions

1. Grind Xylitol in a coﬀee grinder to make into a powder.
1. In a small pot, simmer (not quite at a boil) Heavy Cream, Coconut Milk, Sweetener and Salt until sugar completely dissolves - about 5 minutes.  Remove pot from heat.
1. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks.
1. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about 1/3 of the hot Cream into the Yolks, then whisk the Yolk mixture back into the pot with the Cream.
1. Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 170°F on an instant-read thermometer).
1. Cool mixture to room temperature.
1. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight or keep in refrigerator to speed things up.
1. Churn liquid in an ice cream machine.
1. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.
