### Ingredients

- 3 lbs 85/15 ground turkey
- 2c uncooked rice of your choice (none of it is good for you. Just pick what you like)
- 1 bag of spinach (10oz)
- 2c bone broth

### Instructions

1. mix ground turkey in a bowl with all seasonings you want to use. I typically use s&p, garlic powder, onion powder, some pepper powder, oregano, and whatever else feels right
1. turn instant pot on saute mode and put all ground turkey in to saute like a big ass 3lb burger. Get a sear on one side, flip it as best you can, and sear the other side. This is gonna get chopped up anyway so it's fine if it breaks. Just do your best.
1. Once both sides are seared, break up the meat into chunks that make sense to you.
1. Add rice to instant pot, stir everything together to combine, and then add the broth.
1. Put the lid on the instant pot and pressure cook high for 10 minutes.
1. Once cook is complete, release the steam, open the pot, and add the whole bag of spinach.
1. Replace the lid and select the saute option again. Allow to cook covered for 5 or so minutes. Just enough to wilt the spinach.
1. Remove the lid, stir everything until well combined, and serve!
