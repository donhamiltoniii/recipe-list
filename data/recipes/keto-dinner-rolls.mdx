### Ingredients

- 2 cups shredded cheese mozzarella or cheddar
- 1/4 cup cream cheese softened
- 1 1/2 cups almond flour
- 3 large eggs Divided
- 1 teaspoon baking powder

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. Line a large baking tray with parchment paper and set aside.
1. In a large, microwave safe bowl, add your shredded cheese and cream cheese. Microwave for 30 seconds, or until the cheeses have mostly melted. Remove from the microwave and whisk together, until smooth. Let the cheese cool for several minutes.
1. When the cheese has cooled slightly, add in the almond flour and two of the eggs, and mix well, until a smooth dough remains.
1. Using your hands, form 10 balls of dough. Place them on the lined tray. Whisk the remaining egg and using a pastry brush, brush the exterior of each of the rolls.
1. Bake the rolls for 25 minutes, or until golden on the outside. Serve warm.
