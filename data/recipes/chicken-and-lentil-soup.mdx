### Ingredients

- Chicken breasts (skinless, boneless) - about 1 pound (450g)
- Dried green or brown lentils - 1 cup (rinsed and drained)
- Onion - 1 large (chopped)
- Garlic - 3 cloves (minced)
- Chicken or vegetable broth - 6 cups
- Olive oil - 1 tablespoon
- Salt and pepper - to taste
- Optional: Carrots and celery - 2 of each (chopped) for added flavor and nutrition.

### Instructions

1. Sauté Vegetables: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion (and carrots and celery if you're using them). Sauté until the vegetables are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute.
1. Add Chicken: Add the chicken breasts to the pot and brown them slightly on each side. You don't need to fully cook them yet, just get a little color on them.
1. Add Lentils and Broth: Add the lentils to the pot and stir to combine. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth. Increase the heat to bring the mixture to a boil.
1. Simmer: Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the lentils are soft and the chicken is fully cooked.
1. Shred the Chicken: Remove the chicken breasts from the pot and shred them using two forks. Return the shredded chicken to the pot.
1. Season: Add salt and pepper to taste. If you have fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme, or parsley on hand, they can be added for extra flavor.
1. Serve: Ladle the soup into bowls and enjoy hot.
