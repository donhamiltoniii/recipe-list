### Ingredients

- 1 (2-pound / 907-g) pork tenderloin
- ½ cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese (3 ounces / 85 g)
- ½ cup crumbled feta cheese (3 ounces / 85 g)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons finely crushed raw almonds
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped onions
- ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

### Instructions

1. Use a sharp knife to cut a large pocket in the tenderloin; starting at a short end, slice the meat lengthwise to leave a ½-inch edge on one long side and both short ends.
1. Place the cheeses, garlic, almonds, and onions in a medium-sized bowl and stir to combine. Stuff the cheese mixture into the pocket in the pork.
1. Secure the cut side of the tenderloin with toothpicks to seal in the stuffing. Season on all sides with the salt and pepper. Wrap the stuffed tenderloin in parchment paper.
1. Set a trivet in a 6-quart Instant Pot and pour in 1 cup of cold water. Place the wrapped tenderloin on the trivet.
1. Seal the lid, press Manual, and set the timer for 17 minutes. Once finished, let the pressure release naturally.
1. Remove the tenderloin to a cutting board and allow to rest for 10 minutes, then cut into 1-inch-thick slices and serve.
