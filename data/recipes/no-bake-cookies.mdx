### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons real butter
- â…” cup all natural peanut butter (or your choice of nut butter)
- 1 cup unsweetened all natural shredded coconut
- 4 drops of vanilla Lakanto
- 2 tablespoon granulated sweetener of choice
- 1 tablespoon cocoa powder (optional)

### Instructions

1. In a microwave safe dish, melt the butter. NOTE- if using granulated sweetener instead of the stevia liquid drops , add it here. The sugar will need to dissolve.
1. Stir in the peanut butter until smooth. If you chose to make these with cocoa powder, add it now. There are two flavor versions of these no bake cookies, peanut butter and then the classic chocolate with peanut butter.
1. Next, add stevia (unless you used granulated sweetener) and coconut. Mix well.
1. Using a 2 inch scoop, or eye ball it like I often do, scoop onto cookie sheet. If you wish to line your pan use wax paper so they do not stick. However, these did not stick to our uncovered pan. Once frozen they popped right off.
1. Freeze for 5-10 minutes.
1. Store in a sealed bag, refrigerated. If you do not store these cookies in the fridge they will be sticky.
